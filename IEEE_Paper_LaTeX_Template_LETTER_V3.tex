% in the following email addresses, separate the superscript from the email address 
% using a narrow space \,
% the reason is that Acrobat Reader has an option to auto-detect urls and email
% addresses, and make them 'hot'.  Without a narrow space, the superscript is included
% in the email address and corrupts it.
% Also, removed ~ from pre-superscript since it does not seem to serve any purpose
